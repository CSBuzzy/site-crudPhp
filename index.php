        You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting.
        If you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."
        I told you I was immortal. Oh there are many forms of immortality.
        If you're good at something, never do it for free.
        But it's not who you are underneath... it's what you do that defines you.
        Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.
        It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.
        It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.
        It was a dog. It was a big dog.
        A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.
        I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.
        The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.
        I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?
